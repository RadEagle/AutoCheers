# AutoCheers

Don't have anyone to encourage you?
Are your words of encouragement not motivate you?

You've come to the right place, with my AutoCheer!

Play any voicepack available to get someone to motivate you!

It's that easy! No more searching up your character to find different files.

Oh, did I mention that when you play this file, they speak a random phrase?

## Requirements
  
`pip install pyglet`
  
Once you've installed pyglet, simply download this file and lauch the python file with your Python launcher!

## Notes
Currently only supports Mac OSX, Windows Support will come later.
Currently only two characters are supported. More characters will be added later. :)
