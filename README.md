# AutoCheers

Don't have anyone to encourage you? 
Are your words of encouragement not motivate you? 
You've come to the right place, with my AutoCheer! 
Play any voicepack available to get someone to motivate you! 
It's that easy! No more searching up your character to find different files.

Oh, did I mention that when you play this file, they speak a random phrase?

## Requirements
  
`pip install pyglet`
  
## Downloading
There are two ways you can achieve this:

**Basic**
- Find the green button above README.md, hover it, and click on **Download**

**Terminal**
- `git clone https://github.com/RadEagle/AutoCheers`

## Final Step
Once you've downloaded the file, simply go to the directory where **voicepack.py** is stored and launch it using Python3.

## Notes
Currently only supports MacOS, Windows Support will come later.

Currently only two characters are supported. More characters will be added later. :)
